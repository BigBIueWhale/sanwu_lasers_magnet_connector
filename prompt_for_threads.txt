This is my hello world code for creating a 3d model step file:

```python
# Using Python 3.10.6 and ran: "pip install cadquery==2.4.0 numpy==1.23.5"

# Example using CadQuery to create a cylinder model

import cadquery as cq

# Create a cylinder with height 50mm and radius 10mm
cylinder_model = cq.Workplane("XY").cylinder(50, 10)

# Export the model to an STL file
output_file = "cylinder_model.stl"
cq.exporters.export(cylinder_model, output_file)

output_file
```

I want you to create a full version of this code that entirely produces the final 3d model I want based on my detailed description.

I need the base cylinder to start off being 10mm height and 26mm diameter.

Then put a hole through the shape: 8mm all the way though. This is the hole for the laser light to pass.

On the bottom side I want to make room for a m11.5x0.5 ISO Metric thread. Cut around to leave a protruding 3mm long rod at the bottom as the basis for this thread.

On the top side I want to make room for a m11.5x0.5 ISO Metric tap of depth 6mm.

Make two versions while avoiding code duplications:
One without threads and with well placed comments / text for the chinese engineers explaining exactly what dimensions of threads / taps to use.
One with threads for visual purposes (still with those comments).

Yes, it's complicated to make the standard ISO threads visually, deal with it.
